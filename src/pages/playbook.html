    <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
    <p>This playbook details how we do what we do and <strong>why </strong>. From volunteer recruiting to new member onboarding, and from decision making to conflict resolution&mdash;this Playbook expresses our core values, and declares our critical assumptions. It is a central hub for Prosper as individuals, the organization as a whole, and the community we aim to serve.</p>
    <h2 id="values">Values</h2>
    <h3>purpose</h3>
    <p>At Prosper, purpose is at the heart of everything we do. It is constantly evolving and reflects each individual as well as the organization as a whole. We express our purpose through our actions, in our writing, and in our lives. Here is Prosper's current expressed purpose: <strong>To use design and technology to help refugees prosper in Europe.</strong></p>
    <h3>people</h3>
    <p>We are a people-first organization. Prosper is a community of individuals working towards a shared vision, supported by a shared purpose, and motivated by shared values. When making decisions at Prosper&mdash;no matter how big or small&mdash;people are the top priority:
      <ul>
        <li>What are the needs of the people we aim to serve?</li>
        <li>How are we equipped to help serve their needs?</li>
        <li>What are the needs of the people I work with?</li>
        <li>How can I help serve their needs?</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>We believe people are happier when they are able to fulfill multiple roles as opposed to being constrained by a single 'job title'. Our organization is more flexible than other work environments because of this and allows people to switch roles and fulfill demand based upon their needs (as well as the needs of others).</p>
    <h3>diversity</h3>
    <p>At Prosper, we hold diversity as a key ingredient to the success of any initiative. Innovation teams across the globe have proven the imporance of diverse interdisciplinary teams. We believe it is important to maintain diversity across gender, ethnicity, faith and discpline. At the same time, we realize that differences amongst people can create conflict. We value our ability to harness conflict as a vehicle for constructive change.</p>
    <p>Many of the people across Europe who aren't welcoming to refugees behave this way because they are afraid of the change that refugees will create in their culture and society. We want to embody the possibility of a new European society: One that is founded upon the values of purpose, people diversity and trust.</p>
    <p>Our ability to solve complex problems as a diverse community is a living demonstration of the Europe that is possible when we help refugees prosper.</p>
    <h3>trust</h3>
    <p>Trust is the basis of all that we do. We believe that people are good by nature and deserve to be trusted (unless proven otherwise). We understand that people are imperfect, and thus forgiveness is an integral element in our foundation of trust. We trust <strong>any employee </strong>to make <strong>any decision </strong> within the organization provided they follow the <a href="#communication">advice process</a>. We trust people to set budgets, choose their salary, and act in the best interest of the company.</p>
    <p>We invest a lot of money and attention into how decisions are made and how conflict is resolved. That investment thrives in the trust we place in one another.</p>
    <h3>learning</h3>
    <p>At Prosper, we believe that everyone has something to teach and something to share. Alone we can do nothing, but together, nothing is impossible. </p>
    <p>Fostering a healthy and constructive learning environment is crucial to our work in the refugee crisis. The problems we face are complex and immense. These problems require radical collaboration where the intelligence of the whole organization takes hold. Learning new skills, new communication methods, and new tools is an ongoing process at Prosper.</p>
    <p>We want each member of our team to learn something new every single day and to share that learning with the rest of the team and with the community.</p>
    <h2 id="projects">Projects</h2>
    <p>Projects are the main vehicles for our community's mission to help refugees prosper in Europe. We are currently working the following projects as a community:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="http://refugeeprojects.com/">RefugeeProjects.com</a></li>
    </ul>
    <h3> <a href="http://refugeeprojects.com/">refugeeprojects.com</a></h3>

    </ul>
    <h2 id="taskforces">Taskforces</h2>
    <p>Taskforces are the initiatives focused on improving, maintaining and growing the Prosper community. Here are the active taskforces at Prosper:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="#new-team-member-taskforce">New Team Member Taskforce</a></li>
    </ul>
    <h3 id="new-team-member-taskforce">new team member taskforce</h3>
    <p>We have a New Team Member task force dedicated to helping new team members join Prosper and thrive as contributors. It is comprised of three roles:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Recruit</li>
      <li>Assess</li>
      <li>Onboard</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Whether joining as a volunteer, apprentice or mentor&mdash;we focus a lot of our attention in how we attract and welcome new people to the team. We want to do our best to help new members become confident contributors&mdash;no matter what experience you have or what skills you offer. </p>
    <p>If you are looking to contribute to the New Member task force, check out the Trello board <a href="https://trello.com/b/iQgwzyvb/Prosper-taskforce-new-team-members">Prosper Taskforce: New Members</a>.</p>
    <h3>recruit</h3>
    <p>The recruiting task force is responsible for creating shared understanding about Prosper's purpose, vision and values. This is all about creating and maintaining relationships with passionate professionals who share our purpose. If anyone is attracted by our collective journey they are welcome to contact an Prosper member or request an invite from <a href="/">our website.</a></p>
    <h3>assess</h3>
    <p>Above everything else, we want to attract new team members that share our purpose, vision and values. Our ability to assess potential team members is key to our success as an organization. We are looking to build balanced teams of individuals that are diverse, exhibit integrity, and are dedicated to mastery. Rather than prescribe a list of questions we ask potential team members, we let the assessment personnel decide the best approach. However, there are a few questions we must answer when assessing potential team members:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Does this person's individual purpose fit with our organizational purpose?</li>
      <li>What is their story?</li>
      <li>Why do they want to join Prosper?</li>
      <li>Do they exhibit humility and a desire to learn?</li>
      <li>What kind of weekly time commitment can they offer?</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The assessment process tends to look something like this:</p><img src="{{root}}assets/img/new-team-member-assessment-process.jpg" alt="the typical process of assessing a new Prosper team member">
    <p>If the potential team member doesn't respond after 2 tries contacting them via email we will put them into our "On Hold" list.</p>
    <h3>onboard</h3>
    <p>When a new person decides to join Prosper, it is important that we provide them with the information, tools and mindsets necessary to become a contributing member to the team. One of the roles of our  <a href="/playbook.html">Playbook </a>is to centralize all the information necessary for a new team member to get up to speed with contributing at Prosper. </p>
    <p>The role of onboarding is to add new team members to our tools and provide support with becoming a contributing member to Prosper. Onboarding tends to look something like this:</p><img src="{{root}}assets/img/new-team-member-onboarding-process.jpg" alt="the typical process of onboarding a new Prosper team member">
    <h4>Add New Member to Tools</h4>
    <p>Here is a typical process for adding new team members to the tools we use at Prosper:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Invite to join our <a href="https://solvetherefugeecrisis.slack.com/messages/general/">Slack Team</a></li>
      <li>Add to <a href="https://trello.com/Prosperteam/members">Prosper Team on Trello</a></li>
      <li>Share the <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B4IfPBq2PFbCUGs0ZkNXRzJPSXM">Prosper Docs</a> folder on Google Drive</li>
      <li>Invite to join the <a href="https://github.com/organizations/solve-the-refugee-crisis/invite">Prosper organization on Github</a></li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Email Links & Offer Help</h4>
    <p>We provide a simple <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=13x4RUSB9FsO45hkHfgHrBgwLupXXPYVK5NHDPJ6FNxo">Prosper Onboarding Email Template</a> to make onboarding new team members easier and more consistent.</p>
    <h2 id="time">Time</h2>
    <p>Volunteers make a specific time commitment to Prosper in regards to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>how much <strong>time per week </strong>they volunteer</li>
      <li>how many <strong>months </strong>they'd like to work with us. </li>
    </ul>
    <p>We usually recommend starting with a small commitment of <strong>time per week </strong>and increasing involvement organically if necessary.</p>
    <p>Knowing how many <strong>months </strong>a team member is with us helps set expectations with project teams and task forces. It also allows for a clear and solid resolution to each person's involvement with Prosper. </p>
    <p>At the end of each volunteer's commitment, we ask them whether they'd like to commit to another chapter with us or if we can celebrate their involvement and help them move onto their next destination.</p>
    <h3>80/20 principle</h3>
    <p>We encourage Prosper team members to invest their time as follows:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>80% on <strong>projects</strong></li>
      <li>20% on <strong>task forces</strong></li>
    </ul><img src="{{root}}assets/img/80-20-principle.jpg" alt="the 80/20 principle at solve the refugee crisis">
    <h2 id="contributing">Contributing</h2>
    <p>Once a team member has been onboarded onto Prosper and is up and running with all the tools necessary to contribute, they're asked to introduce themselves to the team on Slack and offer their services to any of the existing <strong>projects </strong>and/or <strong>task forces</strong>.</p>
    <p>We encourage Prosper team members work in pairs to accomplish any given task. This facilitates peer-to-peer <strong>learning </strong>while maintaining <strong>transparency </strong>and <strong>accountability</strong>. Given most Prosper team members are volunteers who have full-time jobs, it also ensures that the task will be completed in a timely manner.</p>
    <p>Whenever a task is assigned to a pair, we also like to set reasonable task deadlines. We want people to maintain a healthy <strong>work-life balance </strong>and also to complete tasks efficiently.</p>
    <h3>assigning tasks</h3>
    <p>Rather than delegate tasks to volunteers, we allow volunteers to assign themselves tasks from the <strong>project </strong>or <strong>taskforce  </strong>backlog. This helps maintain an open atmosphere where each contributor can work on the tasks they deem most desireable. </p>
    <h3>task review</h3>
    <p>For a vast majority of tasks, we like to perform a <strong>peer review </strong>before marking the task 'complete'. Task reviews help us maintain the highest level of <strong>quality </strong>for each contribution. Whether the task relates to design, development or content&mdash;a second pair of eyes is always valued.</p>
    <p>Given our community has a wide spectrum of experience and skills, it is important that we view tasks as an <strong>opportunity </strong>for learning and growth rather than an obligation.</p>
    <h2 id="communication">Communication</h2>
    <p>Because of the complexities that we face as an organization, our ability to communicate is integral to our success. We like to define several explicit communication protocols when it comes to <strong>decision making </strong>and <strong>conflict resolution</strong>.</p>
    <h3>decision making </h3>
    <p>We follow in the footsteps of other Teal organizations in employing an <strong>advice process </strong>when making decisions in our organization.</p>
    <p>The advice process is simple: Any employee can make any decision within the organization provided they consult the advice of all potentially affected parties. This includes other employees, vendors, stakeholders, shareholders, the community and the environment.</p>
    <p>Failing to adhere to the advice process is one of the only behaviors that warrants dismissal from Prosper. We trust our employees with great responsibility and we expect the advice process to be followed at all times. The advice process applies to everyone within the organization: volunteers, paid staff, founders, etc.</p>
    <h3>conflict resolution</h3>
    <p>Unlike other organizations who avoid conflict and have no formal processes for resolving conflict, we adhere to a strict conflict resolution procedure. Whatever the topic, the process starts with one person asking another to gain agreement:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>As a first step, the two people in conflict meet to try and resolve the situation privately. The initiator makes a clear request for a solution (not a judgement or a demand). The other person responds clearly to the request with either a "yes" or proposes another solution.</li>
      <li>If the two people can't find a solution, they choose a colleague to help mediate the conflict.</li>
      <li>If the mediation fails, a relevant group of colleagues is gathered to listen and help form agreement between the two conflicting parties.</li>
      <li>As a final effort, one of the founding members of Prosper can be brought into the conversation to provide additional moral weight.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id="tools">Tools</h2>
    <h3>slack</h3>
    <p>We use Slack, a world-class team communication app, to speak to each other in real-time from across the globe. Slack is a very useful and versatile tool that allows us to group conversations into relevant channels and teams. It also provides a central place to share files. We connect Trello and Github to the <a href="https://solvetherefugeecrisis.slack.com/messages/general/">Prosper Team on Slack</a>. For team members who have never used Slack before and want some guidance, watch <a href="http://quick.as/ral8hgryp">Getting Started with Slack on Prosper.</a></p>
    <h3>trello</h3>
    <p>We use Trello to manage projects. It is a simple tool that is built upon a few basic models:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>boards</li>
      <li>lists</li>
      <li>cards</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We have a Trello board for each project at Prosper. We use lists to structure our tasks under the <a href="http://kanbanblog.com/explained/">Kanban </a>management technique. We create one card for each task, and assign relevant team members to each card so we know who is responsible for each task in progress.</p>
    <p>Each new team member should be added to the relevant <a href="https://trello.com/Prosperteam">Prosper Trello boards.</a> If you've never used <a href="https://trello.com/">Trello</a> and want some guidance, watch <a href="http://quick.as/ljlksly1q">Getting Started with Trello on Prosper.</a></p>
    <h3>github</h3>
    <p>We use Github to collaborate on all of our code-centered projects. Our website and playbook are available as open-source projects on github: <a href="https://github.com/organizations/solve-the-refugee-crisis">solve-the-refugee-crisis</a>. If you're looking to contribute, you'll want to get comfortable using Git and Github.</p>
    <h3>you can book me</h3>
    <p>Prosper has an account at <a href="https://youcanbook.me/">youcanbook.me </a>that allows team members to easily schedule and reschedule meetings with internal and external parties. This is especially useful for scheduling interviews with potential team members.</p>
    <h3>lastpass</h3>
    <p>Prosper uses <a href="https://lastpass.com/">Lastpass</a> to manage secure credentials like usernames and passwords.</p>
    <h2 id="community">Community</h2>
    <p>Prosper is built on the power of human community. We operate in global (digital) and local (physical)  communities&mdash;this combination is integral to our organizational identity. The problems we propose to solve rely on strong local communities supporting people in need. These local communities are then supported by distributed digital communities across the globe.</p>
    <p>We believe that digital relationshiops should <strong>enhance </strong>the power of in-person relationships&mdash;not replace them.</p>
    <h3>digital communities</h3>
    <p>Here are a list of the digital communities that help support Prosper:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="http://www.thefirehoseproject.com/">The Firehose Project</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://www.designerhangout.co/">User Experience Design on Slack</a></li>
      <li><a href="http://www.wiredsussex.com/">Wired Sussex</a></li>
      <li><a href="http://www.techfugees.com/">Techfugees</a></li>
    </ul>
    <p>If you are a member or leader of a digital community and would like to add your community to this list, please feel free to fork this project and submit a pull request on the <a href="https://github.com/johnellison/solve-the-refugee-crisis">Github repo</a>, or <a href="mailto:john@solvetherefugeecrisis.com?subject=Digital%20Community">send us a message.</a></p>
    <h3>local communities</h3>
    <p>Here are a list of the local communities that help support Prosper:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="http://www.meetup.com/Solve-The-Refugee-Crisis-Brighton/">Prosper Brighton</a></li>
      <li>Prosper Montbéliard (Coming Soon...)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If you would like to organize an Prosper Meetup in your local community, please see the 'Organizing a Local Meetup' section below. Please feel free to  <a href="mailto:john@solvetherefugeecrisis.com?subject=Local%20Community">contact us </a>if you need support. Once you have a meetup group, we would be happy to add it to the list.</p>
    <h4>Organizing a Local Meetup</h4>
    <p>These are meant to act as useful guidelines for organizing and facilitating a successful Prosper meetup.</p>
    <h5>purpose</h5>
    <p>We carefully consider the purpose of each Prosper meetup event. We have found that the best meetups occur when diverse groups of people come together under the umbrella of a shared purpose. How we articulate that purpose is crucial. It should be the seed from which all else grows.</p>
    <h5>audience</h5>
    <p>Having a meetup that represents a diverse range of audiences tends to facilitate the most healthy conversations. Consider creating a list of target audiences. This could include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Designers</li>
      <li>Developers</li>
      <li>NGO staff</li>
      <li>Refugee Community Organizations (RCO)</li>
      <li>Refugee representatives</li>
      <li>Refuge / asylum seekers</li>
      <li>Refuge / asylum providers</li>
    </ul>
    <h5>location        </h5>
    <p>The right location and physical space for the meetup is key. A meetup venue which is welcoming, comfortable, spacious and convenient would be ideal.</p>
    <h5>sponsors</h5>
    <p>There are many organizations with funds, materials, time and space. There are fewer organizations willing to donate those resources to good causes, but still&mdash;those organizations do exist. It can be helpful to create a list of potential sponsors and what you'd like to ask from them. Rather than cold-calling people you don't know, it is almost always easier to go through your existing connections.</p>
    <h5>facilitation</h5>
    <p>Facilitation is key to a meetup's success. Depending on the purpose of our meetup event, we might employ different facilitation methods. If the purpose of the event is to facilitate conversation around how digital workers could help solve the refugee crisis&mdash;we've been successful with both one of these techniques:</p>
