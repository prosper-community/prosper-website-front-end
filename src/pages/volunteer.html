      <h2>How Does It Work?</h2>
      <h3>1. request to volunteer</h3>
      <p>
        If you're a skilled digital worker interested in volunteering on <a href="/#projects">Prosper Projects</a>, please provide us with your details in the form below.
      </p>
      <h3>2. wait for us to review your request</h3>
      <p>
        One of our Prosper Community members will review your request and follow-up with you if we think it would be a good fit for us to work together.
      </p>
      <h3>3. receive an invite</h3>
      <p>
        If we think its a good fit for us to work together, we'll send you an invite to join our team. We use <a href="https://trello.com/prospercommunity">Trello</a> to manage projects and <a href="https://prosper-community.slack.com/messages">Slack</a> to communicate in real-time. Other than that, we have weekly stand-ups for project teams and monthly hangouts as a community.
      </p>
      <h3>4. contribute, learn, share (repeat)</h3>
      <p>
        We do our best to help volunteers contribute to a <a href="/#projects">Prosper Project</a> within their first week of joining the community. Hopefully you'll have learned something from contributing and can share what you've learned with the community. Given most of our tasks are broken into their smallest possible parts, you should be able to contribute easily whilst holding down your day job.
      </p>
